# firebaseDemo
Basic Firebase demo that writes and reads. Coded in Kotlin, displays with Compose.

To use, you must have your own API key and other info to connect to the cloud database. This can be done from your Firebase console by generating a google-services.json file, and placing it in the /apps subdirectory.
